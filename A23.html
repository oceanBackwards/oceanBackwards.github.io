        <h3>Physics 121 Lab Report</h4>
                    <a href="Lab D1.pdf" target="_blank">Open PDF</a>
            <p>This lab report is where I believe I started to really understand the content of the course and how to apply it. It also helped me learn how to properly write a lab report for the physics intro series here at UW. Physics 121's labs have really taught me to think more independently when it comes to STEM assignments here at this institution. It has also taught me to think more independently in general, a skill I will use throughout the rest of my degree and in the work force.</p>

        <h3>Chemistry 142 Lab Report</h4>
                    <a href="Chem Lab.pdf" target="_blank">Open PDF</a>
            <p>This lab was a milestone for me. It marked the point where I started to feel confident in my understanding of chemistry, an area I hadn't studied at all prior to this course. Since this lab took longer than usual, I had to work against the clock to get everything done in time. This crunch time helped me prepare for a more fast-paced environment that I may face after college.</p>

        <h3>FIG Mapping to Project</h4>
                    <a href="Fig.pdf" target="_blank">Open PDF</a>
            <p>This was the concluding piece to a quarter-long project that I completed for my FIG course. I had to find campus resources, research them, and utilize them. This helped me ingrain myself into the university's resources more than before and, in a way, forced me to actually start using them. Without this assignment, I would have procrastinated on using these resources.</p>
